## Assessment Cluster Analysis

### Critical Checkpoint Weeks

| Week | Type | Impact | MSBAi Strategy |
|------|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Week 6** | Test 1 (BADM 554) | Foundation check; identifies struggling students | Move to week 5 or 7 to separate from other quizzes |
| **Week 11** | Mini-Project 1 + PCP_2 convergence | Major student stress; overlapping due dates | Stagger: MP1 due week 11, PCP_2 due week 12 |
| **Week 15-16** | All finals converge | All students overwhelmed | Must stagger final deadlines across all courses |

### Recommended MSBAi Assessment Schedule

To reduce crunch weeks, recommend the following changes to on-campus schedule:

| Week | BADM 554 | BDI 513 | BADM 557 | FIN 550 | Rationale |
|------|----------|---------|----------|---------|-----------|
| **6** | Quiz 4 (not Test 1) | - | - | - | Move Test 1 to week 7 |
| **7** | **Test 1** | H4 due | - | - | Separate Test 1 from HW3 |
| **11** | Quiz 8, assignment | - | - | PS1 | Move Mini-Project 1 to week 12 |
| **12** | **Mini-Project 1 due** | PCP_2, PCP_3 due | - | - | Separate from BDI 513 deadlines |
| **14** | Thanksgiving break | Thanksgiving break | Thanksgiving break | Thanksgiving break | Align breaks |
| **15** | Mini-Project 3 discussion | **Presentations** (async option) | **Presentations** (async option) | Causal analysis project | Stretch final presentations |
| **15-16** | **Test 2 due Dec 4** | **Final project due Dec 10** | **Quiz Dec 8**, **Final project due Dec 12** | **Final project due Dec 4**, exam Dec 12 | Slight stagger; still convergent |

**Key Changes:**
- Move Test 1 from week 6 to week 7
- Move Mini-Project 1 from week 11 to week 12 (less stress in week 11)
- Offer asynchronous presentation options (video submission) for students in non-US time zones
- Consider replacing final exams with project-based assessments

## Skill Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-4)
**Primary Skills:** Tool usage, data wrangling, visualization

**Student Activities:**
- Set up SQL/R/Python environments
- Learn SELECT/JOIN queries in SQL
- Create basic visualizations (1D, 2D, time series)
- Perform basic data wrangling and exploration
- Complete DataCamp modules

**Learning Curve:** Steep (tool installation, syntax learning)
**Engagement Risk:** Tool setup issues, environment problems → Need robust tech support

**MSBAi Support Needed:**
- Detailed setup guides (OS-specific)
- Pre-built cloud environments (SQL, R, Python)
- Weekly office hours for environment troubleshooting
- "Getting unstuck" resource hub

---

### Phase 2: Applied Methods (Weeks 5-10)
**Primary Skills:** Regression, classification, statistical thinking

**Student Activities:**
- Advanced SQL querying and database design
- Exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis
- Regression modeling (multiple, logistic, LASSO)
- Classification algorithms (decision trees, KNN, random forest)
- Visualization of model results
- A/B testing and experimental design thinking

**Learning Curve:** Moderate (concepts + coding integration)
**Engagement Peak:** Students see progress and build confidence

**MSBAi Support Needed:**
- Concept videos (explaining statistics clearly)
- Code walkthroughs (seeing it applied)
- Office hours for modeling questions
- Peer learning (classmate code reviews)

---

### Phase 3: Advanced Topics (Weeks 11-13)
**Primary Skills:** Causal inference, text mining, storytelling

**Student Activities:**
- Causal analysis (RCTs, DiD, regression discontinuity)
- Text mining (sentiment analysis, topic modeling, NLP)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Company deep-dive analysis with storytelling
- Integrating multiple analysis methods

**Learning Curve:** Steep (complex concepts, integration challenges)
**Engagement Risk:** Content difficulty increases; students may feel overwhelmed

**MSBAi Support Needed:**
- Extra office hours (weeks 11-13)
- Concept check-ins (is this making sense?)
- Study groups with peer support
- Alternative assignment formats (some students may need flexibility)

---

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Communication (Weeks 14-16)
**Primary Skills:** Presentation, storytelling, project completion

**Student Activities:**
- Final project development and refinement
- Presentation preparation
- Code documentation and sharing
- Connecting all concepts into cohesive analyses
- Practicing job interview narratives

**Learning Curve:** Manageable (familiar content, focus is output)
**Engagement Critical:** Students are exhausted; need finish-line motivation

**MSBAi Support Needed:**
- Project review check-ins
- Presentation coaching
- Final week encouragement and support
- Celebration of accomplishments

## Typical Student Weekly Schedule (Estimated Hours)

| Activity | Hours/Week |
|----------|-----------|
| **Asynchronous lectures/videos** | 3-4 |
| **Hands-on labs/coding** | 4-6 |
| **Assignments/problem sets** | 3-4 |
| **Reading/studying** | 2-3 |
| **Synchronous meetings (office hours, discussions)** | 1-2 |
| **Projects/capstones** | 2-4 |
| **Total** | **15-23** |

**Load Distribution:**
- **Light weeks (1, 14):** 12-15 hours
- **Normal weeks (2-4, 7-10, 12-13):** 16-19 hours
- **Heavy weeks (5-6, 11, 15-16):** 19-23 hours

**MSBAi Design Principle:** Goal is to reduce the "very heavy" weeks (15-23 hours) through better sequencing

---

## Cross-Course Convergence Benefits

**Positive:** Students learn same topics in different contexts
- Week 3-4: Visualization taught in 3 courses (reinforces concepts, shows tool differences)
- Week 5-6: Regression taught in 2-3 courses (deep understanding)
- Week 9-11: Storytelling convergence (powerful for communication skills)

**Challenges:** Assessment deadlines may pile up (week 5-6, 11)

**MSBAi Strategy:** Leverage convergence for portfolio projects (assign during converging weeks) but stagger submission deadlines to avoid crunch

---

## Recommendations for MSBAi Pacing

### 1. **Modify Assessment Schedule**
- Move Test 1 (BADM 554) from week 6 to week 7 to reduce week 6 load
- Stagger Mini-Project deadlines from BDI 513 PCP deadlines
- Replace final exams with final projects where feasible

### 2. **Align Break Weeks**
- Thanksgiving break week 14 (universal across all courses)
- Final project week 15-16 (allow staggered deadlines)

### 3. **Create Support Surge during Heavy Weeks**
- Week 5-6: Extra office hours (statistics help, quiz prep)
- Week 11: Extra office hours (project guidance, causal inference explanation)
- Week 15-16: Presentation coaching and final project feedback

### 4. **Design Cross-Course Portfolio Assignments**
- Week 3-4: Visualization challenge (use in BADM 557 case discussion)
- Week 5-6: Regression analysis (bridge BDI 513 + FIN 550)
- Week 12-13: Text mining case (apply BDI 513 sentiment to BADM 557 project)

### 5. **Asynchronous Flexibility for Online**
- Allow asynchronous presentation submissions (recorded video) for students in non-US time zones
- Provide office hour recordings for students who can't attend live
- Create "study group" prompts for student-led peer learning
