## Program Timeline (By Semester)

### **YEAR 1**

#### **Fall 2026 Semester** (16 weeks)

**Semester Structure:**
- Fall 1 (First Half): Weeks 1-8
- Fall 2 (Second Half): Weeks 9-16

| Course | Credits | Weeks | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| **BADM 554 - Data Foundations** | 4 | Weeks 1-8 | Runs in Fall 1 half only |
| **BDI 513 - Data Storytelling** | 4 | Weeks 5-12 | **Straddles both halves** (starts end of Fall 1, ends middle of Fall 2) |
| **FIN 550 - Analytics for Business** | 4 | Weeks 9-16 | Runs in Fall 2 half only |
| **Semester Total** | **12** | | 3 courses, 1 straddles |

**Student Experience:** Students take 2 courses at once (weeks 5-8 overlap: BADM 554 + BDI 513), then 2 courses at once (weeks 9-12 overlap: BDI 513 + FIN 550)

#### **Spring 2027 Semester** (16 weeks)

**Semester Structure:**
- Spring 1 (First Half): Weeks 1-8
- Spring 2 (Second Half): Weeks 9-16

| Course | Credits | Weeks | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| **BADM 558 - Big Data Infrastructure** | 4 | Weeks 1-8 | Runs in Spring 1 half only |
| **Generative AI for Analytics** | 2 | Weeks 1-4 | Runs in Spring 1 (first 4 weeks, concurrent with 558) |
| **Quantum Computing for Optimization** | 2 | Weeks 9-12 | Runs in Spring 2 (first 4 weeks) |
| **Semester Total** | **8** | | |

**Student Experience:**
- Weeks 1-4: BADM 558 (4 cr) + GenAI (2 cr) = 6 credits simultaneously
- Weeks 5-8: BADM 558 (4 cr) only
- Weeks 9-12: Quantum Computing (2 cr) only
- Weeks 13-16: Open (no courses)

| **BADM 576 - Data Science & Machine Learning** | 4 | Weeks 1-8 | Runs in Fall 1 half only |
| **Specialization Elective** | 4 | Weeks 9-16 | Finance, Healthcare, Marketing, or Data Engineering track |
| **Semester Total** | **8** | | |

**Cumulative after Fall 2027: 32 credits**

## Key Design Principles

### 1. **8-Week Courses in 16-Week Semesters**
- Each course is 8 weeks long (half a traditional semester)
- Students take 2-3 courses per semester
- Courses can run in first half (weeks 1-8), second half (weeks 9-16), OR straddle both (e.g., weeks 5-12)

### 2. **Straddling Courses**
- **BDI 513 (Fall 2026)**: Weeks 5-12 (straddles Fall 1 + Fall 2)
  - Starts week 5 (end of Fall 1) when BADM 554 content is established
  - Ends week 12 (middle of Fall 2) before FIN 550 ramps up
  - Allows storytelling to build on SQL foundations from 554
  - Gives students time to finish FIN 550 project work

### 3. **Credit Distribution**
- Fall 2026: 12 credits
- Spring 2027: 10 credits (or 12 if Quantum elective taken)
- Summer 2027: 4 credits
- Fall 2027: 8 credits
- **Total: 34-36 credits**

## Comparison: On-Campus vs. Online

| Aspect | On-Campus MSBA | MSBAi Online |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Course Length** | 16 weeks | 8 weeks |
| **Courses per Semester** | 4 courses concurrently (Fall 2025: 554, 513, 557, 550) | 2-3 courses, some staggered/straddled |
| **Fall Semester Load** | 16 credits (4 courses × 4 cr) | 12 credits (3 courses, 1 straddles) |
| **Total Duration** | 1 year (2 semesters) | 18 months (4 semesters + 1 summer) |
| **Weekly Workload** | 15-20 hrs/week per student | 15-20 hrs/week per student (same) |

## Notes for Faculty & Instructional Design

1. **Straddling courses require careful coordination:**
   - BDI 513 starts week 5 → BADM 554 faculty must cover prerequisite SQL/data concepts by week 4
   - BDI 513 ends week 12 → FIN 550 faculty should minimize heavy workload weeks 9-12

2. **Week numbering resets each semester:**
   - Fall 2026: Weeks 1-16
   - Spring 2027: Weeks 1-16 (NOT 17-32)
   - Summer 2027: Weeks 1-8 (NOT 33-40)
   - Fall 2027: Weeks 1-16 (NOT 41-56)

3. **Student overlap periods:**
   - **Weeks 5-8 (Fall 2026):** Students take BADM 554 + BDI 513 simultaneously
   - **Weeks 9-12 (Fall 2026):** Students take BDI 513 + FIN 550 simultaneously
   - **Weeks 1-8 (Spring 2027):** Students take BADM 557 + GenAI elective simultaneously
