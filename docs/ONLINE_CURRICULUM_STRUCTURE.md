## Key Design Changes: On-Campus → Online

### **Time Compression (16 weeks → 8 weeks)**

| Aspect | On-Campus (16 wks) | Online (8 wks) | Implication |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Total hours | ~64 hours | ~32 hours | 50% content reduction or faster pace |
| Weekly workload | 15-20 hrs/week | 15-20 hrs/week | Same weekly load, shorter duration |
| Async lectures | 4-5 hrs/week | 4-5 hrs/week | More dense, fewer "filler" topics |
| Hands-on labs | 3-4 hrs/week | 3-4 hrs/week | Condensed to essential only |
| Assessments | Spread over 16 weeks | Spread over 8 weeks | More frequent checkpoints |
| Exams | 1-2 per course | 0-1 (mostly project-based) | Shift to continuous assessment |

**MSBAi Strategy:**
- ✅ Remove non-essential topics (focus on core skills)
- ✅ Batch similar concepts (e.g., visualization across 2-3 courses in same week)
- ✅ Intensive project-based learning (1-2 major projects per course)
- ✅ No traditional exams (replace with capstone & demonstrations)
- ✅ Built-in flexibility for global time zones (all async-first)

### **Python + Jupyter as Common Thread**

All MSBAi courses will use Python + Jupyter Notebooks, though:
- **Allowed:** Additional tools for specific needs (SQL, Tableau, R, AWS, etc.)
- **Common ground:** All students work in Python/Jupyter environment
- **Portability:** Students build portfolio of Jupyter notebooks across entire degree

**Implementation Notes:**
- Standardize Jupyter setup (Google Colab OR JupyterHub + cloud hosting)
- Provide pre-configured environments for each course
- Notebooks become learning artifacts (not throwaway code)

## Capstone/Practicum Design (Fall 4, 4 credits)

**Current notes from curriculum:**
- "May include portfolio element; or a two-part portfolio/client project sequence"

**Options:**
1. **Portfolio approach:** Students curate 3-4 best projects from degree
2. **Client project:** Real-world data problem (partner with local business/nonprofit)
3. **Hybrid:** 2-week portfolio + 6-week client project
4. **Industry specialization:** Finance/healthcare/tech capstone track

**Recommendation:** Client project with portfolio showcase
- **Weeks 1-2:** Portfolio assembly (reflect + write narratives)
- **Weeks 3-8:** Client project (discovery → analysis → presentation)
- **Output:** GitHub repo + Jupyter notebook + video presentation

---

## Program-Wide Design Principles

### **1. Python + Jupyter First**
- All courses use Python + Jupyter as primary environment
- Tools like Tableau, SQL, AWS are supplements, not replacements
- Notebooks become portfolio pieces

### **2. 8-Week Intensity**
- Fast-paced but manageable (same weekly hours as on-campus)
- Assessment every 2 weeks (mini-projects, labs, quizzes)
- No "down weeks" (every week is productive)

### **3. Asynchronous-First**
- All lectures pre-recorded (watch on your schedule)
- All assignments async submission (global time zone support)
- Optional sync: Weekly office hours (Friday 10am UTC?)
- Sync optional capstone presentations

### **4. Project-Based Assessment**
- No traditional exams
- Continuous mini-projects (every 2-3 weeks)
- Major capstone per course (final project)
- Portfolio approach for final capstone

### **5. Cross-Course Convergence**
- **Week 2-3:** Visualization (554 SQL → 513 Tableau → 576 matplotlib)
- **Week 4-5:** Regression (513 analysis → 550 finance → 557 BI)
- **Week 6-7:** Classification/clustering (550 → 576)
- **Week 7-8:** Synthesis & presentations (all courses)

### **6. Stackable Certificates**
- **Core Certificate:** BADM 554 + FIN 550 + BDI 513
- **AI Analytics Certificate:** BADM 557 + AI Elective + additional course
- **Data Engineering Certificate:** BADM 558 + BADM 576 + capstone

   - AI Analytics Elective (2 credits, Spring 1) - content spec
   - Quantum Computing (2 credits, Spring 1) - course rubric
   - Fall 3 Elective (4 credits) - required or flexible?
3. ⏳ **Create course adaptation specs for 8-week online format**

### **Next (Week of Jan 20)**
1. Create **COURSE_ADAPTATIONS.md** with detailed 8-week syllabus for each course
2. Create **ELECTIVES_ROADMAP.md** with specialization tracks (Finance, Tech, Healthcare, etc.)
3. Create **COHORT_MODEL.md** with sync touchpoints, community building, support structure

### **Following (Week of Jan 27)**
1. **Create learning outcome maps** (MSBAi LOs vs. course LOs)
2. **Design assessment framework** (rubrics, grading criteria)
