## Part 4: Global Time Zone Strategy

### Time Zone Accommodation Approach

**Rationale:**
- 30%+ international students expected
- No single time zone works for everyone
- Async-first philosophy enables flexibility

### Implementation

**Synchronous Session Timing:**

Three rotating time slots for Project Studio (repeat weekly):

| Slot | Time (UTC) | Covers |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **A** | Tue 10:00-11:30 | Americas (California morning, East Coast evening) |
| **B** | Wed 18:00-19:30 | Europe evening, West Africa morning, South America late night |
| **C** | Sat 14:00-15:30 | Australia/Asia morning (Thu evening in US = Sat morning in AU) |

**Student Choice:**
- At enrollment, choose preferred slot (A, B, or C)
- Can switch mid-semester with notice
- All sessions recorded for async access (no penalty for missing live)

**Office Hours:**
- Spread across 24 hours (at least 2-3 slots daily)
- Instructors work shift pattern (some early, some late)
- Discord/async for true async-first students

**Analytics Conversation (Guest Speakers):**
- Schedule at "middle" time that's reasonable for Americas + Europe (11:00-12:30 UTC)
- Record immediately for Asia/Pacific access
- Recorded Q&A available on forum (async participation)

### Time Zone Support Resources

**Documentation:**
- "What time is that in my timezone?" converter (link in every syllabus)
- Course calendar in each student's local timezone (Canvas integration)
- Monthly schedule announcement 2 weeks in advance

**Flexibility:**
- No "must be online at this time" requirement
- All major deadlines 11:59pm UTC (late enough for Americas, early enough for Australia)

## Part 10: Cohort Model Metrics & Success Criteria

### Community Health Metrics

| Metric | Target | How Measured |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Discord engagement** | 50%+ students post per week | Message count, unique posters |
| **Studio attendance** | 70%+ live attendance | Zoom attendance logs |
| **Office hours usage** | 60%+ students use at least once | Sign-up sheets |
| **Peer mentoring** | 80%+ have 1+ interaction with buddy | Buddy survey |
| **Course satisfaction** | NPS >70 | End-of-course survey |
| **Sense of belonging** | 75%+ feel part of cohort | Survey question: "I feel part of a community" |
| **Mental health** | Minimal crisis incidents | Refer to counseling office |
| **Retention** | 90%+ complete degree | Enrollment tracking |

### Engagement Interventions (If Metrics Slip)

**Low Discord Engagement:**
- Instructor highlights best discussions (feature student work)
- Gamification: "Helpful response of the week" + recognition
- Spark conversations (pose interesting questions)

**Low Studio Attendance:**
- Survey: "Why didn't you attend? Technical barrier? Timing? Motivation?"
- Adjust scheduling if timezone issue
- Show recordings are valuable (add transcripts + highlights)
- Celebrate those who attend (peer pressure, positive)

**Low Office Hours Usage:**
- Normalize asking for help ("Expert engineers pair program")
- Instructor offers 1-on-1 check-ins (proactive)
- TA-led group tutoring (safer than 1-on-1 for anxious students)

## Part 11: Comparison to On-Campus & Other Online Programs

| Aspect | On-Campus | MSBAi | Other Online |
|--------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| **Sync Hours/Week** | 15-20 | 4-7 (studio + office) | 0-2 (optional) |
| **Community Feel** | High (same building, daily interaction) | Moderate-High (cohort-based, regular touchpoints) | Low (mostly individual) |
| **Support** | In-person TAs + office hours | Online TAs + recorded sessions | FAQ + limited support |
| **Flexibility** | Low (attend at specific times) | High (attend live or watch recording) | Very high (completely async) |
| **Cost** | $$$ | $$ (20% cheaper) | $ (or $$) |
| **Networking** | Built-in (classmates daily) | Intentional (Discord, affinity groups) | Ad-hoc (some cohorts form) |

**MSBAi Positioning:** "Community-driven online learning" — not as rigid as on-campus, not as isolating as completely async.
