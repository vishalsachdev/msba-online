## ❓ FAQs

**Q: Can students do this part-time?**
A: Yes. 8-week courses allow taking 1-2 courses per term while working. Most students take 2 courses/term (12 credits/year) → 3-year path. Some accelerate to 4 courses/term → 24-month path.

**Q: What if I miss a studio session?**
A: No penalty. All sessions recorded + uploaded within 24 hours. Async-first philosophy means you can catch up on your schedule.

**Q: Is AI tool use (Claude, ChatGPT) encouraged?**
A: Yes. We teach responsible AI usage. Students learn when to use AI vs. do manual work. AI is integrated into every course as a productivity tool.

**Q: Will there be real-time exams?**
A: No. All assessment is project-based. Projects demonstrate competency better than exams. No proctored exams.

**Q: How much time should I expect to spend per week?**
A: 15-20 hours/week on average. Includes: lectures (4-5 hrs), projects (6-8 hrs), studio sessions (1.5-2 hrs), readings/assignments (3-4 hrs). Intensive but doable for working professionals.
