**Last Updated:** January 13, 2026

This document tracks course renaming decisions for the MSBAi online program to improve clarity, market positioning, and student understanding.

---

## Summary of Changes

| Original Name | New Name | Rationale | Status |
|---------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **BADM 554** - Data Systems & Engineering | **BADM 554 - Data Foundations** | "Engineering" term misaligned with content focus; "Foundations" better describes SQL + Python + ETL basics | ✅ Updated everywhere |
| **BADM 557** - Business Intelligence with AI | **BADM 557 - Decision Intelligence with AI** | Modernizes "BI" term; emphasizes decision outcomes vs. tools; aligns with industry trends (Gartner, Forrester) | ✅ Updated everywhere |

---

## Rationale Details

### BADM 554: Data Foundations

**Old Name:** "Data Systems & Engineering" / "Enterprise Database Management"

**Issues:**
- "Engineering" suggests software engineering depth (not the course focus)
- "Enterprise Database Management" too narrow (course includes ETL, Python, not just databases)
- Inconsistent naming across documents

**New Name Benefits:**
- Accurately reflects content: SQL, Python, databases, ETL pipelines
- Clearer for prospective students (foundational data skills)
- Pairs well with course sequence: **Data Foundations** → **Data Storytelling** → **Analytics for Business** → **Decision Intelligence with AI**

### BADM 557: Decision Intelligence with AI

**Old Name:** "Business Intelligence with AI"

**Issues:**
- "Business Intelligence" feels dated (20th century term)
- "with AI" is vague and tacked-on
- Doesn't differentiate from traditional BI courses

**New Name Benefits:**
- **Industry momentum:** Gartner, Forrester, and leading tech companies now use "Decision Intelligence with AI"
- **Modern positioning:** Emphasizes outcome (making better decisions) vs. process (analyzing data)
- **AI-native:** "Intelligence" inherently implies AI/ML without needing to say "with AI"
- **Career relevance:** Job postings increasingly use "Decision Intelligence with AI" over "Business Intelligence"
- **Course focus:** Better describes content—using analytics + AI to make business decisions through cases

**Course Description (Updated):**
> "Apply AI-augmented analytics to real business decisions through case studies, building intelligent dashboards and decision frameworks using Python, Tableau, and modern AI tools. Focus on decision outcomes, not just data visualization."

## Future Considerations

**Potential Additional Changes (Not Implemented Yet):**

| Current Name | Potential Alternative | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| FIN 550 - Big Data Analytics in Finance | FIN 550 - Analytics for Business | Remove "Finance" for broader appeal; already discussed in constraints doc |
| BADM 558 - Big Data Infrastructure | BADM 558 - Data Engineering | More recognizable job title; "Big Data" less trendy now |
| BADM 576 - Data Science & Analytics | BADM 576 - Applied Machine Learning | More specific about ML focus |

**Decision:** Hold on further changes until first cohort feedback (Fall 2026).
