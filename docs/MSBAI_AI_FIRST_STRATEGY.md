# MSBAi: AI-First Strategy Document

**Launch:** Fall 2026 (Fall 1 term)  
**Strategic Positioning:** "Analytics-to-Action with AI-Assured Outcomes"  
**Key Differentiation:** AI-native curriculum + applied experiential learning + flexible pathways  
**Informed By:** Undergrad AI integration strategy + IBC market research + MSBA course portfolio

---

## Executive Summary

MSBAi is a **24-month online Master of Science in Business Analytics designed with AI as the central organizing principle**, not a supplementary topic. Every course integrates practical AI tools, prompt engineering, and LLM-assisted analysis. The program combines:

- **8-week modular format** (enabling workforce flexibility)
- **Python + Jupyter Notebooks** as the common computational backbone
- **Applied experiential learning** (capstones, consulting projects, corporate partnerships)
- **Three stackable pathways** (Core Analytics, AI Analytics, Industry Specialization)
- **Career-first design** for mid-career professionals ("promotion seekers" and "career pivoters")

**Target Market:** Working professionals seeking career advancement in analytics + AI, with emphasis on affordability, flexibility, and concrete job placement outcomes.

## Part 1: AI-First Curriculum Philosophy

### Why "AI" Must Be in the Name & Core

The **IBC market research** identified a critical insight: *"AI fluency + adaptability"* is the **top emerging capability employers expect**. Yet most programs treat AI as an elective topic or afterthought.

**MSBAi Strategic Differentiation:**
1. **AI is not optional.** Every student graduates with:
   - Hands-on LLM experience (ChatGPT, Claude, open-source models)
   - Prompt engineering and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) skills
   - Practical understanding of model evaluation and responsible AI
   - Portfolio of AI-assisted analytics projects

2. **AI-native tools, not AI as theory.** Students use AI *as a tool* to accelerate analytics work:
   - AI for data exploration and hypothesis generation
   - AI for code generation and debugging (pair programming with LLMs)
   - AI for automating routine analysis tasks
   - AI for storytelling and communication

3. **Aligned with Gies' Campus AI Framework.** MSBAi contributes to the official Campus AI curriculum tracks:
   - **AI Basics/Fundamentals:** All students achieve literacy
   - **AI & ML Technologies:** Mid-level competency in applied ML
   - **Agentic Systems & Workflows:** Design AI-enhanced business processes
   - **Human-Centric AI:** Ethics, governance, responsible AI integration

### Programming Model: L-C-E (Literacy → Competency → Expertise)

All MSBAi learning outcomes follow the **Literacy-Competency-Expertise** progression (adapted from UNESCO AI framework):

| Level | Definition | Bloom's Level | In MSBAi Context |
|-------|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| **Literacy (L)** | Foundational understanding of AI concepts, capabilities, limitations | Remember, Understand | "Explain what an LLM is; recognize its limitations" |
| **Competency (C)** | Practical application skills using AI tools in business workflows | Apply, Analyze | "Use Claude/ChatGPT to accelerate your analysis; evaluate outputs critically" |
| **Expertise (E)** | Advanced development, customization, and strategic application | Evaluate, Create | "Design AI-enhanced analytics workflows; lead adoption initiatives" |

**Progression Path:**
- **Fall 1-2 (Core Courses):** L → C (Build AI literacy + foundational competency)
- **Spring 1-2 (Electives):** C → E (Deepen competency, start moving to expertise)
- **Summer-Fall 3-4 (Specialization + Capstone):** E (Apply expertise to real business problems)

---

## Part 2: Core Curriculum (8-Week Redesign)

### Design Principles

1. **Python + Jupyter Notebooks as computational backbone**
   - All students work in same environment (reproducibility, peer learning, portfolio building)
   - Jupyter books with integrated text, code, visualizations
   - Pre-built environments (Google Colab, cloud-hosted JupyterHub)
   - Students build portfolio of notebooks across entire degree

2. **AI-assisted content delivery**
   - Shorter, denser lectures (10-15 min vs. traditional 50 min)
   - Interactive coding walkthroughs with AI pair-programming examples
   - Auto-generated summary notes and study guides
   - Students use Claude/ChatGPT for personalized tutoring

3. **Project-based assessment** (no traditional exams)
   - 2-3 major projects per 8-week course
   - Continuous mini-assessments (weekly labs, reflections)
   - Real datasets, real business questions
   - Portfolio-ready outputs (GitHub repos, Jupyter notebooks, dashboards)

4. **Cross-course convergence**
   - Week 3-4: All courses converge on **visualization & storytelling** (SQL, Python, Tableau)
   - Week 5-6: All courses converge on **regression analysis** (finance, business problems)
   - Week 7-8: **Synthesis & presentations** (all courses capstone simultaneously)

5. **AI-enhanced collaboration**
   - Students use AI agents for research, literature review, brainstorming
   - Teach "AI crediting" (how to cite and acknowledge AI contributions)
   - Build study groups using shared Claude projects for collaborative coding
