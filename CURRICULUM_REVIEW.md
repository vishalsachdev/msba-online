## Executive Summary

This document reviews the MSBAi curriculum against current research on AI-first education, online assessment alternatives, and topic scaffolding best practices. The review addresses three critical questions:

1. **Is the curriculum coherent for an AI-first world?** ✅ Strong foundation with specific improvements needed
2. **Are the assessment strategies viable for online async?** ⚠️ Good start, needs attribution/reflection components
3. **Is the topic sequencing optimal?** ✅ Well-designed with minor adjustments recommended

**Key Findings:**
- MSBAi is well-positioned against competitors with AI-first positioning
- Project-based assessment approach aligns with research best practices
- Current sequencing (554→513→550→557→558→576) is pedagogically sound
- **Critical Gap:** Need explicit AI attribution and process documentation requirements
- **Enhancement Opportunity:** Add oral defense components to capstone projects

## Part 1: AI-First Curriculum Trends Analysis

### Current Research Frameworks

#### HCAIF Framework (Human-Centered AI in Finance/Education)
Modern AI-first curricula follow a five-phase integration model:

| Phase | Description | MSBAi Alignment |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Preparation** | Students engage with AI before class sessions | ✅ Async-first design enables this |
| **Personalized Learning** | AI adapts to individual learner needs | ⚠️ Implicit; could be more explicit |
| **Classroom Engagement** | Active AI-assisted problem-solving | ✅ Studio sessions + project work |
| **Summative Assessment** | AI-aware evaluation methods | ⚠️ Needs attribution requirements |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Track skill development over time | ✅ Progressive project complexity |

**Recommendation:** Make personalized learning explicit by encouraging students to use AI tutoring for weak areas identified in formative assessments.

#### AI Jockey Model (Yale, 2024-2025)
The "AI Jockey" paradigm treats AI as a tool to be directed skillfully, not a replacement for thinking:

> "Students become AI jockeys—steering, evaluating, and refining AI outputs rather than passively consuming them."

**MSBAi Alignment:** ✅ Strong—the curriculum already emphasizes AI as "productivity accelerator" and requires students to evaluate AI outputs critically. The Generative AI for Analytics elective specifically teaches this skill.

#### SAIL Framework (Stanford AI Learning)
Stanford's framework emphasizes three pillars:

1. **Situational Awareness:** Know when AI helps vs. when manual work is better
2. **Attribution Discipline:** Document AI contributions transparently
3. **Iterative Refinement:** Improve AI outputs through prompt engineering

**MSBAi Gap:** Attribution discipline is mentioned but not enforced. Recommend adding explicit AI attribution requirements to all project rubrics.

#### 70/5 Rule (Industry Research, 2025)
Research suggests:
- **70%** of analytics professionals need basic AI literacy (prompt engineering, output evaluation)
- **5%** need advanced AI development skills (fine-tuning, RAG systems, custom models)

**MSBAi Alignment:** ✅ The stackable pathway model addresses both:
- Core Analytics Certificate → 70% (AI literacy)
- AI Analytics Certificate + Full Master's → 5% (expertise via GenAI elective + capstone)

### Competitive Curriculum Analysis

| Program | AI Integration | Distinctive Feature | MSBAi Comparison |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **MIT MBAn** | High (required AI courses) | Capstone with corporate partners | MSBAi matches with Research Park partnerships |
| **UCLA MSBA** | Moderate (AI electives) | Strong quantitative focus | MSBAi exceeds with AI-first design |
| **CMU MISM** | High (ML required) | Tech industry placement | MSBAi comparable, different industry focus |
| **UT Austin MSBA** | Moderate (ML electives) | Affordability | MSBAi targets 20% cheaper |
| **Georgia Tech OMS Analytics** | Low-Moderate | Scale + affordability | MSBAi differentiates with AI-first + studio sessions |

**Key Differentiator:** No competitor explicitly positions as "AI-First" or requires AI integration in every course. This is MSBAi's unique market position.

## Part 2: Online Assessment Strategy Review

### The Challenge: Traditional Assessments at Risk

Traditional exams in online asynchronous programs face three critical vulnerabilities:

1. **AI Completion Risk:** Students can use AI to complete traditional assignments without learning
2. **Identity Verification:** Proctoring is expensive, intrusive, and often circumventable
3. **Authenticity Gap:** Exam performance doesn't demonstrate workplace-ready skills

**MSBAi's Current Approach:** Project-based assessment with no traditional exams—this is well-aligned with research.

### Research-Based Assessment Frameworks

#### FACT Framework (Fundamental-Applied-Conceptual-Thinking)
Modern AI-aware assessment divides evaluation into four components:

| Component | Description | Weight (Recommended) | MSBAi Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Fundamental** | Basic knowledge demonstration | 10-15% | Quizzes, DataCamp modules |
| **Applied** | Hands-on skill application | 40-50% | Projects (✅ 70-90% in MSBAi) |
| **Conceptual** | Understanding "why" and "when" | 15-20% | Case write-ups, reflections |
| **Thinking** | Novel problem-solving | 20-25% | Open-ended project components |

**Assessment:** MSBAi over-weights Applied (good for skill-building) but may under-weight Conceptual. Recommend adding "design rationale" sections to project rubrics.

#### AI Assessment Scale (AIAS)
A 5-level framework for specifying permitted AI use:

| Level | AI Permitted | When to Use | MSBAi Mapping |
|-------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **0** | No AI | Testing foundational knowledge | Proctored certification exams (if any) |
| **1** | AI for ideation only | Early exploration | Week 1-2 of projects |
| **2** | AI with attribution | Standard projects | Most project work |
| **3** | AI as collaborator | Advanced applications | Final projects, capstone |
| **4** | AI as subject of analysis | GenAI course | Generative AI for Analytics |

**Recommendation:** Explicitly label each assignment with its AIAS level. This sets clear expectations and teaches appropriate tool use.

#### Process-Product Model
Research shows evaluating both the deliverable AND the process prevents AI over-reliance:

| Dimension | What to Evaluate | Implementation |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Product** | Final deliverable quality | Current rubrics (✅) |
| **Process** | How the student approached the problem | Require "methodology log" |
| **Iteration** | How the student refined their work | Version history on GitHub |
| **Reflection** | What the student learned | Post-project reflection essays |

**Critical Addition for MSBAi:** Require a "Process Documentation" section in every major project:
- What approaches were tried?
- What AI tools were used and how?
- What was learned from failures?
- How was AI output validated?

### Oral Defense Component

Research strongly supports oral components for online programs:

> "Oral defenses remain the most reliable assessment method for verifying understanding in AI-enabled environments."

**Recommended Implementation for MSBAi:**

| Course Component | Oral Weight | Format |
|------------------|-------------|--------|
| **Studio Sessions** | 10% (participation) | Live Q&A during sessions |
| **Major Projects** | 20-30% oral defense | 10-15 min video presentation + live Q&A |
| **Capstone** | 40-50% oral defense | 20 min presentation + 10 min Q&A |

**Weighting Recommendation:** Shift to 60% written/code deliverables + 40% oral demonstration for major projects. This:
- Verifies student understanding
- Develops presentation skills (employer-valued)
- Reduces AI over-reliance risk

## Part 3: Topic Scaffolding & Sequencing Analysis

### Current MSBAi Sequencing

```
Fall 1 (Wks 1-8):     BADM 554 (Data Foundations) + BDI 513 Part 1 (Storytelling)
Fall 2 (Wks 9-16):    FIN 550 (Analytics) + BDI 513 Part 2
Spring 1 (Wks 17-24): BADM 557 (Decision Intelligence with AI) + GenAI Elective
Spring 2 (Wks 25-32): BADM 558 (Big Data Infrastructure)
Summer (Wks 33-40):   BADM 576 (Data Science & ML)
Fall 3 (Wks 41-48):   Elective (specialization)
Fall 4 (Wks 49-56):   Capstone
```

### Research-Based Sequencing Principles

#### Principle 1: SQL + Python Together First
Research from CMU and MIT curricula shows:

> "Teaching SQL and Python together in the first course creates immediate transferable skills and prevents tool siloing."

**MSBAi Status:** ✅ BADM 554 does this well—SQL fundamentals + Python (pandas, sqlalchemy) in weeks 1-6.

#### Principle 2: Statistics Before ML
The optimal sequence is:

```
Data Manipulation → Descriptive Stats → Visualization → Regression → Classification → Unsupervised
```

**MSBAi Status:** ✅ Well-designed:
- BADM 554: Data manipulation
- BDI 513: Visualization + descriptive exploration
- FIN 550: Regression + classification
- BADM 576: Full ML lifecycle including unsupervised

#### Principle 3: Visualization Early
Tufte-informed curricula place visualization early (within first 3-4 weeks) because:
- It's immediately rewarding (students see results)
- It supports exploratory data analysis
- It's less intimidating than algorithms

**MSBAi Status:** ✅ BDI 513 Part 1 runs concurrently with BADM 554, introducing visualization in Week 1.

#### Principle 4: Spiral Curriculum (Bruner)
Topics should be revisited at increasing depth across courses:

| Topic | First Exposure | Deeper Treatment | Advanced Application |
|-------|---------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **SQL** | 554 (wks 1-3) | 558 (Spark SQL) | 576 (feature engineering) |
| **Regression** | 550 (wks 3-4) | 557 (business cases) | 576 (regularization) |
| **Visualization** | 513 (wks 1-4) | 557 (dashboards) | 576 (model interpretation) |
| **Classification** | 550 (wks 5-6) | 557 (BI decisions) | 576 (ensemble methods) |
| **Clustering** | 557 (wk 6) | 576 (advanced) | Capstone (application) |

**MSBAi Status:** ✅ The curriculum naturally implements spiral learning through cross-course convergence.

#### Principle 5: 8-Week Compression Strategy
Research on compressed course formats suggests:

| 16-Week Element | 8-Week Adaptation | Risk Mitigation |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 2 midterms + final | 3 progressive projects | Continuous feedback |
| Weekly problem sets | Every-other-week labs | AI-assisted practice |
| 50-min lectures | 15-20 min videos + studio | Active learning focus |
| Office hours (random) | Scheduled studio sessions | Guaranteed access |

**MSBAi Status:** ✅ The design follows these principles. Project-based assessment naturally fits compression.

### Sequencing Recommendations

#### Minor Adjustment 1: Earlier Cloud Exposure
Currently, cloud infrastructure (558) comes in Spring 2 (weeks 25-32). Consider:

- Adding a "Cloud Foundations" module (2-3 hours) to BADM 554 (Week 7)
- Students set up AWS account, create S3 bucket, run basic cloud SQL
- Reduces cognitive load when full 558 arrives

**Impact:** Smoother transition; students comfortable with cloud before deep-dive.

#### Minor Adjustment 2: Text/NLP Earlier
Currently, text analysis appears only in BADM 576 (Week 38). Consider:

- BDI 513 Part 2 (Week 13-14): Add sentiment analysis of earnings calls using Claude API
- This aligns with the financial deep-dive project

**Impact:** Students see NLP applications in business context earlier.

#### No Changes Needed: ML Prerequisites
The current prerequisite chain is optimal:

```
554 (SQL/Python) → 550 (Stats/ML basics) → 558 (Infrastructure) → 576 (Advanced ML)
```

This follows the "data engineering → analysis → infrastructure → science" progression used by MIT and Berkeley.

## Part 4: Curriculum Coherence Analysis

### Strengths

| Dimension | Assessment | Evidence |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **AI-First Integration** | ✅ Strong | AI tools in every course; dedicated GenAI elective |
| **Python/Jupyter Backbone** | ✅ Excellent | Universal across all courses |
| **Project-Based Learning** | ✅ Excellent | 2-3 major projects per course, no exams |
| **L-C-E Progression** | ✅ Well-implemented | Clear literacy→competency→expertise across program |
| **Cross-Course Convergence** | ✅ Thoughtful | Visualization, regression, classification clusters |
| **Stackable Pathways** | ✅ Flexible | Three clear certificate options |
| **Studio Sessions** | ✅ Differentiating | Live project-focused sessions rare in competitors |

### Gaps & Improvement Opportunities

#### Gap 1: AI Attribution Requirements (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** No explicit requirement to document AI tool usage in projects.

**Risk:** Students may over-rely on AI without developing independent skills; faculty can't assess true competency.

**Recommendation:** Add to all project rubrics:

```
AI ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT (5% of project grade)
- Document all AI tools used (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- For each AI use, describe: prompt given, output received, how you modified/validated
- Include "AI Contribution Log" as appendix to all major projects
- Failure to attribute is academic integrity violation
```

#### Gap 2: Process Documentation (IMPORTANT)
**Issue:** Rubrics focus primarily on deliverables, not learning process.

**Risk:** Students submit polished AI-generated work without demonstrating understanding.

**Recommendation:** Add "Methodology & Process" rubric dimension (10-15% weight):

| Criterion | Excellent | Proficient | Developing |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Approach Documentation** | Clear explanation of methodology choices | Describes main steps | Minimal process description |
| **Iteration Evidence** | Shows multiple attempts, refinements | Some iteration visible | Single-pass submission |
| **AI Usage Transparency** | Detailed AI contribution log | Basic AI attribution | Missing or vague |
| **Self-Reflection** | Insightful analysis of what worked/didn't | Some reflection | No reflection |

#### Gap 3: Oral Defense Component (IMPORTANT)
**Issue:** Limited live assessment beyond studio participation.

**Recommendation:** Add oral defense to major projects:

| Project Type | Oral Component | Format |
|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Course Projects (1-2) | 15% of grade | 8-10 min video + 5 min live Q&A |
| Capstone | 40% of grade | 20 min presentation + 15 min defense |

#### Gap 4: Ethics Integration (MINOR)
**Issue:** Responsible AI mentioned but not consistently embedded.

**Recommendation:** Add ethics checkpoint to each course:

- **554:** Data privacy in ETL pipelines
- **513:** Misleading visualizations, AI-generated misinformation
- **550:** Algorithmic bias in financial predictions
- **557:** BI ethics, surveillance capitalism
- **558:** Cloud security, data sovereignty
- **576:** Model fairness, deployment ethics

Each course includes 1 case study or reflection on ethical dimensions (Week 7 or 8).

#### Gap 5: Peer Learning Structure (ENHANCEMENT)
**Issue:** Peer review mentioned but not structured.

**Recommendation:** Formalize peer learning:

| Component | Implementation | Weight |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Code Review** | Each student reviews 2 peer projects per course | 5% of grade |
| **Study Pods** | Assign 4-person study groups in Week 1 | Encouraged, not graded |
| **Peer Feedback on Presentations** | Structured rubric during studio sessions | Formative only |
